# Project title:  Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Python  


# mporting Libraries and Dataset:  
Load the necessary Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and WordCloud. The project uses the Flipkart Reviews Dataset.


# Data Preprocessing:  
Clean the dataset by removing missing and duplicate values. The text is converted to lowercase, and stopwords, punctuation, and special characters are removed. Sentiment labels are encoded (Positive = 1, Negative = 0). The data is then tokenized using TF-IDF.


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
Visualize the sentiment distribution using count plots and create a word cloud to identify common words in positive and negative reviews.


# Model Training and Selection:  
Train different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and compare their performance using accuracy and F1-score.


# Model Evaluation and Prediction:  
Evaluate the best model using accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. The final model can classify new reviews as positive or negative.
