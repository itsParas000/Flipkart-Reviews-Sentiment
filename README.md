# Project title:  Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Python  


# Importing Libraries and Dataset:  
Load the necessary Python libraries like  
pandas  
matplotlib  seaborn  
scikit-learn  
WordCloud  

The project uses the Flipkart Reviews Dataset.
# flipkart_data.csv  



# Data Preprocessing:  
Clean the dataset by removing missing and duplicate values. The text is converted to lowercase, and stopwords, punctuation, and special characters are removed. Sentiment labels are encoded (Positive = 1, Negative = 0). The data is then tokenized using TF-IDF.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
Visualize the sentiment distribution using count plots and create a word cloud to identify common words in positive and negative reviews.

# Model Training and Selection:  
Train different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and compare their performance using accuracy and F1-score.

# Model Evaluation and Prediction:  
Evaluate the best model using accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. The final model can classify new reviews as positive or negative.
